Description

This script displays a rain effect.
The script  includes a HTML code generator that allows 
to change parameters without any knowledge of JavaScript and HTML programming.
You can use freely the script to enhance your web pages.
If you want to remove the credits message and enable additional
parameters you can register all 'DS ScriptsFX' for only $20.

Registration

With $20 (US dollars) you can receive the registration key for a specified
URL domain name, for example www.yoursite.com or members.site.com/yoursite.
You must provide the URL name and you will receive the registration key
via e-mail. The registration key must be inserted in the regkey
parameter and it unlocks all 'DS ScriptsFX' for registered URL domain name.
The scripts will run on all the pages of the site and the new scripts that
will be released in future will work too with the registration key you buy now.
Registered scripts don't display the credits message and have enabled
additional parameters.
